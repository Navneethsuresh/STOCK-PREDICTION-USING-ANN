The dataset contains 6 columns and 2467 rows

THE COLUMNS ARE:

open - Price at which a security first trades when an exchange opens for the day. An opening price is not identical to the previous day's closing price.

high - The highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price.

low - The lowest price at which a stock trades over the course of a trading day.

close - The close is a reference to the end of a trading session in the financial markets when the markets close for the day.

adj close - Adjusted close is the closing price after adjustments for all applicable splits and dividend distributions.

volume - The total number of shares traded in a specified time frame. This would include every share that is bought and sold during the time period in review.
